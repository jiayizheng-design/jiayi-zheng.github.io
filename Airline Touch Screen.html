	<h2>Project Overview:</h2>
    <p>Designing a touch screen with different features for an airline. It serves the purpose of providing services to passengers during the flight (especially long-haul flights). I aimed to create a convenient service experience.</p>

    <h2>Research/Observation</h2>
	<p>Most aircraft's touch applications are not attractive and well-designed. The functions are very simple, but regarding the services in the aircraft, there are more functions that the application can have for providing a better experience for the passengers.</p>
	  <h2>Insights</h2>
    <p>1. From my personal experience and user research, one of the most common needs when passengers call over an attendant is to ask for drinks or snacks. The attendants need to go to the passengers twice to complete demands.</p>
    <p>2. One of the most frustrating things on the long-haul flight is waiting for the vacant bathroom especially for passengers of the middle seats who have to take efforts to get out from their seats.</p>
	<h2>Solutions</h2>
    <p>1. <strong>Quick Services System</strong> - Allow passengers to choose basic needs such as water, coffee, tea, and snacks, and attendants would only to go once in general situations. It also enables passengers to see the options in terms of the categories of drinks and snacks. </p>
    <p>2. <strong>Lavatory Situation Checking System</strong> - Allow passengers to check the lavatory occupation situation in real-time to avoid unnecessary waiting time.</p>
    <p class="notes">***Problem of the system: A line of waiting for bathrooms still happens. When one person comes out from the bathroom, the real-time lavatory vacancy status would update to that it is not occupied. Another person may go in after, and the passengers in the seats who see the vacancy status of the bathroom may have already stand up and missed the updated status has been taken by another person in a few seconds. </p>
    <p class="notes">**Solution for this problem: Set a 5-second delay to update the vacant statues since the next person in the line would usually take about 5 seconds to get in and lock the door. </p>
